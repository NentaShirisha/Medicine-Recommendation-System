# Medicine-Recommendation-System
This system provides veterinarians with instant, evidence-based medication suggestions directly within the Patient Module's SOAP Plan section. By analyzing the patient's historical data, active diagnoses, and vital signs, it drastically reduces the time spent on manual drug research, dosage calculation, and cross-referencing contraindications.

Goal:   To minimize human error and intervention in the critical process of prescribing, ensuring patient safety and compliance with the clinicâ€™s formulary.
